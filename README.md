# Local-Compaction-Plot-LCP

This Jupyter Notebook reads in the distance files (two examples provided above) to create a Local Compaction Plot (LCP).

The first example ('result0_wt.txt') contains sliding window distance readings from 40,000 frames of molecular dyanmics simulation of human MYC (residues 91-160)
The second example ('result1_D132-H.txt') contains sliding window distance readings from 40,000 frames of molecular dyanmics simulation of human MYC (residues 91-160 with residue D132 substituted with H).
